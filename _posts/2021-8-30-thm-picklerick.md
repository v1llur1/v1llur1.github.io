In this writeup I will be solving the CTF of [Pickle Rick room](https://tryhackme.com/room/picklerick).

### CTF Theme

This Rick and Morty themed challenge requires you to exploit a webserver to find 3 ingredients a.k.a flags that will help Rick make his potion to transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

> ‚úîÔ∏è Deploy the virtual machine on this task and explore the web application.

<summary>What is the first ingredient Rick needs? </summary>
<br>

- After deploying and exploring the web application I found one **USERNAME** in the source code as **R1ckRul3s**
- Now, I have enumerated the pages and discovered several pages like **login,**  **robots**.
- In **/robots.txt** page I found one string **Wubbalubbadubdub**.
- I used the gathered info as login data at **/login.php**.
- Command panel was shown after successful login.
- After listing contents on the web server through command panel (as www-data), I found few interesting files. One of the file was **Sup3rs3cretPick13Ingred.txt**
- Finally, I found the first flag at **Sup3rs3cretPick13Ingred.txt** file which is `mr. meeseek hair`

- I looked around other file paths for the second ingredient.
- After exploring I found two users on the machine **rick** and **ubuntu**<br> at **/home** directory.
- I looked in rick's directory and discovered a file called **second ingredients**
- Commands like *cat*, *more* were not executing in the command panel. I have used *less* command to print out the contents of **second ingredients** file.
