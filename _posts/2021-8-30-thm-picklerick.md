<summary>What is the first ingredient Rick needs?</summary><br>
- After deploying and exploring the web application I found one <b>USERNAME</b> in the source code as <b>R1ckRul3s</b> <br>
- Now, I have enumerated the pages and discovered several pages like <b>login,</b>  <b>robots</b>.<br>
- In <b>/robots.txt</b> page I found one string <b>Wubbalubbadubdub</b>.<br>
- I used the gathered info as login data at <b>/login.php</b>.<br>
- Command panel was shown after successful login.<br>
