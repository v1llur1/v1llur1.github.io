In this writeup I will be explaining about my bash [script](https://github.com/v1llur1/automated-exploit-downloader).

### About the script

I have coded my bash script for automatically downloading multiple exploits directly to the local machine based on given bash argument with single enter key from official [exploit-db](https://exploit-db.com).

My script deals with exploits from exploit-db so make sure that [searchsploit](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb) is installed in the machine.

### Short Demo Clip

**P.S: Searchsploit comes by default in Kali Linux.**
