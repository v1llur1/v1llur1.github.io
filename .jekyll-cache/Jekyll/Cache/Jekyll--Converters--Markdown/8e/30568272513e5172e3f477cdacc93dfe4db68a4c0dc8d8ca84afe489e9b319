I"W<p>In this writeup I will be explaining about my <a href="https://github.com/v1llur1/automated-exploit-downloader">script</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-script">About the script</h3>

<p>Iâ€™ve coded my bash script to automatically download multiple exploits to the local machine with single click from official <a href="https://exploit-db.com">exploit-db website</a>.</p>

<p>My script deals with exploits from exploit-db so make sure that <a href="https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb">searchsploit</a> is installed in the machine.</p>

<p>Searchsploit comes by default in Kali Linux</p>
